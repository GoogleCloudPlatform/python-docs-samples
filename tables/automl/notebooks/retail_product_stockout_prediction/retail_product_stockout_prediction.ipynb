While out-of-stocks can occur along the entire supply chain, the most visible kind are retail out-of-stocks in the fast-moving consumer goods industry (e.g., sweets, diapers, fruits). Stockouts are the opposite of overstocks, where too much inventory is retained.\n","\n","#### **Impact**\n","According to a study by researchers Thomas Gruen and Daniel Corsten, the global average level of out-of-stocks within retail fast-moving consumer goods sector across developed economies was 8.3% in 2002. This means that shoppers would have a 42% chance of fulfilling a ten-item shopping list without encountering a stockout. Despite the initiatives designed to improve the collaboration of retailers and their suppliers, such as Efficient Consumer Response (ECR), and despite the increasing use of new technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) and point-of-sale data analytics, this situation has improved little over the past decades.\n","\n","The biggest impacts being\n","\n","*   Customer dissatisfaction\n","*   Loss of revenue\n","\n","\n","\n","#### **Machine Learning Solution**\n","Using machine learning to solve for stock-outs can help with store operations and thus prevent out-of-stock proactively.\n","\n","There are three big challenges any retailer would face as they try and solve this problem with machine learning:\n","\n","1.   Data silos: Sales data, supply-chain data, inventory data, etc. may all be in silos. Such disjoint datasets could be a challenge to work with as a machine learning model tries to derive insights from all these data points.\n","2.   Missing Features: Features such as vendor location, weather conditions, etc. could add a lot of value to a machine learning algorithm to learn from. But such features are not always available and when building machine learning solutions we think for collecting features as an iterative approach to improving the machine learning model.\n","3.  Imbalanced dataset: Datasets for classification problems such as retail stock-out are traditionally very imbalanced with fewer cases for stock-out. Designing machine learning solutions by hand for such problems would be time consuming effort when your team should be focusing on collecting features.\n","\n","Hence, we recommend using AutoML Tables. With AutoML Tables you only need to work on acquiring all data and features, and AutoML Tables would do the rest. This is a one-click deploy to solving the problem of stock-out with machine learning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SLq3FfRa8E8X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Costs**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DzxIfOrB71wl","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform (GCP):\n","\n","* Cloud AI Platform\n","* Cloud Storage\n","* BigQuery\n","* AutoML Tables\n","\n","Learn about [Cloud AI Platform pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/pricing), [Cloud Storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing), [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing), [AutoML Tables pricing](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/pricing), and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ze4-nDLfK4pw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Set up your local development environment**\n","\n","**If you are using Colab or AI Platform Notebooks**, your environment already meets\n","all the requirements to run this notebook.
