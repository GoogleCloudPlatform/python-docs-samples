"""Google Cloud Speech-to-Text streaming sample demonstrating Beta features

This sample builds upon the `transcribe_streaming_mic.py` sample in the
same directory.

NOTE: This module requires the additional dependency `pyaudio`. To install
using pip:

    pip install pyaudio

Example usage:
    python beta_streaming_mic.py
