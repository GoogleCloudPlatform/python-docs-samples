unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors \
deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all \
medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the \
shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring break and it is \
very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my \
vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.

Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It was not \
the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month. I saw this \
movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my \
local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not \
regret it.

My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first \
came out. We have most lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still \
get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. \
Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I\'m not her \
biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene \
is when Arthur is visiting his fianc√©e\'s house. His conversation with the \
butler and Susan\'s father is side-spitting. The line from the butler, \
"Would you care to wait in the Library" followed by Arthur\'s reply, \
"Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL \
notification on my computer.

This Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon \
Brando stands out. There\'s a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland \
that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. I\'m still trying to \
figure out why Charlie want to change his name.
