    Updates or creates an access configuration for a VM instance to assign a static external IP.
    As network interface is immutable - deletion stage is required in case of any assigned ip (static or ephemeral).
    VM and ip address must be created before calling this function.
    IMPORTANT: VM and assigned IP must be in the same region.

    Args:
        project_id (str): Project ID.
        zone (str): Zone where the VM is located.
        instance_name (str): Name of the VM instance.
        ip_address (str): New static external IP address to assign to the VM.
        network_interface_name (str): Name of the network interface to assign.

    Returns:
        google.cloud.compute_v1.types.Instance: Updated instance object.
