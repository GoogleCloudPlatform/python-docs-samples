# Google Compute Engine Samples

This section contains samples for [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute).

## Running the samples

1. Your environment must be setup with [authentication
information](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork). If you're running on Compute Engine, this is already setup.

2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Depending on the sample, you may also need to create resources on the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com). Refer to the sample description and associated documentation page.
