Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python quickstart.py


Snippets
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python snippets.py

    usage: snippets.py [-h] logger_name {list,write,delete} ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations on logs and
    log entries with Stackdriver Logging.
    
    For more information, see the README.md under /logging and the
    documentation at https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs.
    
    positional arguments:
      logger_name          Logger name
      {list,write,delete}
        list               Lists the most recent entries for a given logger.
        write              Writes log entries to the given logger.
        delete             Deletes a logger and all its entries. Note that a
                           deletion can take several minutes to take effect.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit


Export
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python export.py

    usage: export.py [-h] {list,create,update,delete} ...
    
    positional arguments:
      {list,create,update,delete}
        list                Lists all sinks.
        create              Lists all sinks.
        update              Changes a sink's filter. The filter determines which
                            logs this sink matches and will be exported to the
                            destination. For example a filter of 'severity>=INFO'
                            will send all logs that have a severity of INFO or
                            greater to the destination. See https://cloud.google.c
                            om/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters for more filter
                            information.
        delete              Deletes a sink.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
