The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Sunlight:** Sunlight is composed of all the colors of the rainbow.

2. **Earth's Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny particles like nitrogen and oxygen molecules.

3. **Scattering:** These particles scatter the sunlight in all directions. However, blue light (which has a shorter wavelength) is scattered more effectively than other colors.

4. **Our Perception:** As a result, we see a blue sky because the scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions.

**Why not other colors?**

* **Violet light** has an even shorter wavelength than blue and is scattered even more. However, our eyes are less sensitive to violet light, so we perceive the sky as blue.
* **Longer wavelengths** like red, orange, and yellow are scattered less and travel more directly through the atmosphere. This is why we see these colors during sunrise and sunset, when sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere.
