If you are familiar with image classification problems, you can think of the bands as similar to an image's RGB channels.

To deal with the sparsity, at training time we'll prepare a dataset where each input image is a single pixel that we have a label for. We will then add a padding around that image. These padded pixels will not get predictions, but will help our model to make better predictions for the center point that we have a label for.\n",
