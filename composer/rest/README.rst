This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Composer. `Google Cloud Composer`_ is a managed Apache Airflow service that helps you create, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. Cloud Composer automation helps you create Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.

Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Determine client ID associated with a Cloud Composer environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python get_client_id.py
    usage: get_client_id.py [-h] project_id location composer_environment

    Get the client ID associated with a Cloud Composer environment.

    positional arguments:
      project_id            Your Project ID.
      location              Region of the Cloud Composer environment.
      composer_environment  Name of the Cloud Composer environment.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

In case of any issue with `get_client_id.py`, you can also get the client ID using the following command, where `AIRFLOW_URL` would be the URL of your Airflow webserver (ex. `https://*****************-tp.appspot.com`_):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -v AIRFLOW_URL 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -o "client_id\=[A-Za-z0-9-]*\.apps\.googleusercontent\.com"

To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python get_dag_prefix.py

    usage: get_dag_prefix.py [-h] project_id location composer_environment

    Get a Cloud Composer environment via the REST API.

    This code sample gets a Cloud Composer environment resource and prints the
    Cloud Storage path used to store Apache Airflow DAGs.

    positional arguments:
      project_id            Your Project ID.
      location              Region of the Cloud Composer environment.
      composer_environment  Name of the Cloud Composer environment.
