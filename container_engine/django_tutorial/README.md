This repository is an example of how to run a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
app on Google Container Engine. It uses the
[Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)
Polls application (parts 1 and 2) as the example app to deploy. From here on
out, we refer to this app as the 'polls' application.


# Tutorial
See our [Django on Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/container-engine) tutorial for instructions for setting up and deploying this sample application.
