# Cloud Run End User Authentication with PostgreSQL Database Sample

This sample integrates with the Identity Platform to authenticate users to the
application and connects to a Cloud SQL postgreSQL database for data storage.

Use it with the [End user Authentication for Cloud Run](http://cloud.google.com/run/docs/tutorials/identity-platform).

For more details on how to work with this sample read the [Google Cloud Run Python Samples README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/main/run).

## Dependencies

* **flask**: web server framework
* **firebase-admin**: verifying JWT token
* **sqlalchemy + pg8000**: postgresql interface
* **Firebase JavaScript SDK**: client-side library for authentication flow

## Environment Variables

Cloud Run services can be [configured with Environment Variables](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/environment-variables).
Required variables for this sample include:

* `CLOUD_SQL_CREDENTIALS_SECRET`: the resource ID of the secret, in format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/secrets/SECRET_ID/versions/VERSION` when deployed to Cloud Run. At runtime, Cloud Run will inject the secret value as an environment variable, for more info see [Using secrets](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets#command-line). See [postgres-secrets.json](postgres-secrets.json) for secret content.

OR

* `CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME`: Cloud SQL instance name, in format: `<MY-PROJECT>:<INSTANCE-REGION>:<MY-DATABASE>`
* `DB_NAME`: Cloud SQL postgreSQL database name
* `DB_USER`: database user
* `DB_PASSWORD`: database password

Other environment variables:

* Set `TABLE` to change the postgreSQL database table name.

* Set `DB_HOST` to use the proxy with TCP. See instructions below.

* Set `DB_SOCKET_PATH` to change the directory when using the proxy with Unix sockets.
  See instructions below.

## Production Considerations

* Both `postgres-secrets.json` and `static/config.js` should not be committed to
  a git repository and should be added to `.gitignore`.

* Saving credentials directly as environment variables is convenient for local testing,
  but not secure for production; therefore using `CLOUD_SQL_CREDENTIALS_SECRET`
  in combination with the Cloud Secrets Manager is recommended.  

## Running Locally

1. Set [environment variables](#environment-variables).

1. To run this application locally, download and install the `cloud-sql-proxy` by
[following the instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy#install).

The proxy can be used with a TCP connection or a Unix Domain Socket. On Linux or
Mac OS you can use either option, but on Windows the proxy currently requires a TCP
connection.

[Instructions to launch proxy with Unix Domain Socket](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/main/cloud-sql/postgres/sqlalchemy#launch-proxy-with-unix-domain-socket)

[Instructions to launch proxy with TCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/main/cloud-sql/postgres/sqlalchemy#launch-proxy-with-tcp)

## Testing

Tests expect the Cloud SQL instance to already be created and environment Variables
to be set.

### Unit tests

```sh
pytest test_app.py
```

### System Tests

```sh
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
export CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=<YOUR_CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME>
export DB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD>
export IDP_KEY=<IDENTITY_PLATFORM_API_KEY>  # See tutorial for creation of this key ("API_KEY")
pytest e2e_test.py
```
