    """
    This method shows how to create a sample Batch Job that will run
    a simple command on Cloud Compute instances created using a provided Template.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        region: name of the region you want to use to run the job. Regions that are
            available for Batch are listed on: https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/get-started#locations
        job_name: the name of the job that will be created.
            It needs to be unique for each project and region pair.
        template_link: a link to an existing Instance Template. Acceptable formats:
            * "projects/{project_id}/global/instanceTemplates/{template_name}"
            * "{template_name}" - if the template is defined in the same project as used to create the Job.

    Returns:
        A job object representing the job created.
