    """
    This method shows how to create a sample Batch Job that will run
    a simple command on Cloud Compute instances with passing secrets from secret manager.
    Note: Job's service account should have the permissions to access secrets.
        - Secret Manager Secret Accessor (roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor) IAM role.

    Args:
        project_id: project ID or project number of the Cloud project you want to use.
        region: name of the region you want to use to run the job. Regions that are
            available for Batch are listed on: https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/get-started#locations
        job_name: the name of the job that will be created.
            It needs to be unique for each project and region pair.
        secrets: secrets, which should be passed to the job. Environment variables should be capitalized
        by convention https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#constants-and-environment-variable-names
            The format should look like:
                - {'SECRET_NAME': 'projects/{project_id}/secrets/{SECRET_NAME}/versions/{version}'}
            version can be set to 'latest'.
        service_account_email (optional): custom service account email

    Returns:
        A job object representing the job created.
