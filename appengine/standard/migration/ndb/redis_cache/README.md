This is a sample app for Google App Engine that demonstrates how to replace
use of the [Datastore NDB Python API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/)
with the [Google Cloud NDB library](https://googleapis.dev/python/python-ndb/latest/index.html).
This library can be used not only on App Engine, but also other Python 3
platforms.

This sample also uses
[Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/redis-overview)
caching to improve NDB performance in some situations.

Prior to deploying this sample, a
[serverless VPC connector](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access)
must be created and then a
[Memorystore for Redis instance](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/quickstart-console)
on the same VPC. The IP address and port number of the Redis instance, and
the name of the VPC connector should be entered in `app3.yaml`.

To deploy and run this sample in App Engine standard for Python 3.8:

    gcloud app deploy app3.yaml index.yaml
