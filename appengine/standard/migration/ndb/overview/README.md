This is a sample app for Google App Engine that demonstrates how to replace
use of the [Datastore NDB Python API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/)
with the [Google Cloud NDB library](https://googleapis.dev/python/python-ndb/latest/index.html).
This library can be used not only on App Engine, but also other Python 3
platforms.

To deploy and run this sample in App Engine standard for Python 3.8:

    gcloud app deploy app3.yaml
