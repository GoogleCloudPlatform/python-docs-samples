This repository is an example of how to run a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
app on Google App Engine Standard Environment. It uses the 
[Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as the 
example app to deploy.


# Tutorial
See our [Running Django in the App Engine Standard Environment](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine) tutorial for instructions for setting up and deploying this sample application.
