    # Example Response:
    #     Okay, let's solve the quadratic equation x² + 4x + 4 = 0.
    #
    #     We can solve this equation by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or by recognizing it as a perfect square trinomial.
    #
    #     **Method 1: Factoring**
    #
    #     1.  We need two numbers that multiply to the constant term (4) and add up to the coefficient of the x term (4).
    #     2.  The numbers 2 and 2 satisfy these conditions: 2 * 2 = 4 and 2 + 2 = 4.
    #     3.  So, we can factor the quadratic as:
    #         (x + 2)(x + 2) = 0
    #         or
    #         (x + 2)² = 0
    #     4.  For the product to be zero, the factor must be zero:
    #         x + 2 = 0
    #     5.  Solve for x:
    #         x = -2
    #
    #     **Method 2: Quadratic Formula**
    #
    #     The quadratic formula for an equation ax² + bx + c = 0 is:
    #     x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
    #
    #     1.  In our equation x² + 4x + 4 = 0, we have a=1, b=4, and c=4.
    #     2.  Substitute these values into the formula:
    #         x = [-4 ± sqrt(4² - 4 * 1 * 4)] / (2 * 1)
    #         x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 16)] / 2
    #         x = [-4 ± sqrt(0)] / 2
    #         x = [-4 ± 0] / 2
    #         x = -4 / 2
    #         x = -2
    #
    #     **Method 3: Perfect Square Trinomial**
    #
    #     1.  Notice that the expression x² + 4x + 4 fits the pattern of a perfect square trinomial: a² + 2ab + b², where a=x and b=2.
    #     2.  We can rewrite the equation as:
    #         (x + 2)² = 0
    #     3.  Take the square root of both sides:
    #         x + 2 = 0
    #     4.  Solve for x:
    #         x = -2
    #
    #     All methods lead to the same solution.
    #
    #     **Answer:**
    #     The solution to the equation x² + 4x + 4 = 0 is x = -2. This is a repeated root (or a root with multiplicity 2).
