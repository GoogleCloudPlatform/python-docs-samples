    # Example response:
    #     To solve the equation $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0$, you can use several methods:
    #     **Method 1: Factoring**
    #     1.  Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (4) and add up to the coefficient of the $x$ term (4).
    #     2.  The numbers are 2 and 2 ($2 \times 2 = 4$ and $2 + 2 = 4$).
    #     ...
    #     ...
    #     All three methods yield the same solution. This quadratic equation has exactly one distinct solution (a repeated root).
    #     The solution is **x = -2**.
