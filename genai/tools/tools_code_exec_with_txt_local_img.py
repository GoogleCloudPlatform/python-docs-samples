    Run a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem with 1,000 trials.
    Here's how this works as a reminder. In the Monty Hall Problem, you're on a game
    show with three doors. Behind one is a car, and behind the others are goats. You
    pick a door. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens a different door
    to reveal a goat. Should you switch to the remaining unopened door?
    The answer has always been a little difficult for me to understand when people
    solve it with math - so please run a simulation with Python to show me what the
    best strategy is.
    Thank you!
