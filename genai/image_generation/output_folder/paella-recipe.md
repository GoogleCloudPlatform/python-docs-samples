Okay, I will generate an illustrated recipe for paella, creating an image for each step.

**Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients**

This includes short-grain rice, chicken thighs and drumsticks, chorizo sausage, shrimp, mussels, clams, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, garlic cloves, peas (fresh or frozen), saffron threads, paprika, olive oil, chicken broth, a lemon, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper. Each ingredient should be clearly visible and arranged artfully.
