    `Google BigQuery`_ is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost
    analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to
    manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on
    analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take
    advantage of our pay-as-you-go model.
