"""Configures Open Telemetry instrumentation for Gen AI SDK.

Configuring observability for the Gen AI SDK involves two steps:

  1. Ensuring that data is written to Open Telemetry APIs when
     the Gen AI SDK is used.

  2. Ensuring that the Open Telemetry APIs route data to some
     observability backend(s) for storing the data.

This file addresses #1. This also means that this file can be used
for observability of the Gen AI SDK in cases where you choose an
observability backend other than those of Google Cloud Observability.\
