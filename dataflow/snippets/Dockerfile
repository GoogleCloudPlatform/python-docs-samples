# NOTE: The KafkaIO connector for Python requires the JRE to be installed
# in the execution environment. This Dockerfile enables the
# "dataflow_kafka_read" snippet to be tested without installing the JRE
# on the host machine. This Dockerfile is derived from the
# dataflow/custom-containers/ubuntu sample.
