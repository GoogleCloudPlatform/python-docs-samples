# For reproducible builds, it is better to also include transitive dependencies:

# but for simplicity of this example, we are only including the top-level dependencies.
apache_beam[gcp]==2.58.0
immutabledict==4.2.0

# Also required, please download and install gemma_pytorch.
#   git clone https://github.com/google/gemma_pytorch.git
