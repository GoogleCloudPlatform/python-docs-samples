# Dataflow Flex Template: a pipeline with dependencies and a custom container image.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](http://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples&page=editor&open_in_editor=dataflow/flex-templates/streaming_beam/README.md)

This project illustrates the following Dataflow Python pipeline setup:
- The pipeline is a package that consists of [multiple files](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#multiple-file-dependencies).
- The pipeline has at least one dependency that is not provided in the default Dataflow runtime environment.
- The workflow uses a [custom container image](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-custom-containers) to preinstall dependencies and to define the pipeline runtime environment.
- The workflow uses a [Dataflow Flex Template](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/dataflow-templates) to control the pipeline submission environment.
- The runtime and submission environment use same set of Python dependencies and can be created in a reproducible manner.

To illustrate this setup, we use a pipeline that does the following:

1. Finds the longest word in an input file
2. Creates a [FIGLet text banner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet) from of it using [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/)
3. Outputs the text banner in another file


## The structure of the example

The pipeline package is comprised of the `my_package` directory and the `setup.py` file. The package defines the pipeline, the pipeline dependencies, and the input parameters. You can define multiple pipelines in the same package. The `my_package.launcher` module is used to submit the pipeline to a runner.

The `main.py` file provides a top-level entrypoint to trigger the pipeline launcher from a
launch environment.

The `Dockerfile` defines the runtime environment for the pipeline. It also configures the Flex Template, which lets you reuse the runtime image to build the Flex Template.

The `requirements.txt` file defines all Python packages in the dependency chain of the pipeline package. Use it to create reproducible Python environments in the Docker image.

The `metadata.json` file defines Flex Template parameters and their validation rules. It is optional.

## Before you begin

1. Follow the
   [Dataflow setup instructions](../../README.md).

1. [Enable the Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com).

1. Clone the [`python-docs-samples` repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples)
and navigate to the code sample.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples.git
    cd python-docs-samples/dataflow/flex-templates/streaming_beam
    ```

## Create a Cloud Storage bucket

```sh
export PROJECT="project-id"
export BUCKET="your-bucket"
export REGION="us-central1"
gsutil mb -p $PROJECT gs://$BUCKET
```

## Create an Artifact Registry repository

```sh
export REPOSITORY="your-repository"
gcloud artifacts repositories create $REPOSITORY \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=$REGION

gcloud artifacts repositories create $REPOSITORY \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=$REGION \
    --project $PROJECT

gcloud auth configure-docker $REGION-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Build a Docker image for the pipeline runtime environment

Using a [custom SDK container image](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-custom-containers)
allows flexible customizations of the runtime environment.

This example uses the custom container image both to preinstall all of the pipeline dependencies before job submission and to create a reproducible runtime environment.

To illustrate customizations, a [custom base base image](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/build-container-image#use_a_custom_base_image) is used to build the SDK container image.

The Flex Template launcher is included in the SDK container image, which makes it possible to [use the SDK container image to build a Flex Template](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/configuring-flex-templates#use_custom_container_images).

```sh
# Use a unique tag to version the artifacts that are built.
export TAG=`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`
export SDK_CONTAINER_IMAGE="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$REPOSITORY/my_base_image:$TAG"

gcloud builds submit .  --tag $SDK_CONTAINER_IMAGE --project $PROJECT
```

## Optional: Inspect the Docker image

If you have a local installation of Docker, you can inspect the image and run the pipeline by using the Direct Runner:
```
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash $SDK_CONTAINER_IMAGE

# Once the container is created, run:
pip list
python main.py --input requirements.txt --output=/tmp/output
cat /tmp/output*
```

## Build the Flex Template

Build the Flex Template [from the SDK container image](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/configuring-flex-templates#use_custom_container_images).
Using the runtime image as the Flex Template image reduces the number of Docker images that need to be maintained.
It also ensures that the pipeline uses the same dependencies at submission and at runtime.

```sh
export TEMPLATE_FILE=gs://$BUCKET/longest-word-$TAG.json
export TEMPLATE_IMAGE=$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$REPOSITORY/my_template_image:$TAG
```

```sh
gcloud dataflow flex-template build $TEMPLATE_FILE  \
    --image $SDK_CONTAINER_IMAGE \
    --sdk-language "PYTHON" \
    --metadata-file=metadata.json \
    --project $PROJECT
```

## Run the template

```sh
gcloud dataflow flex-template run "flex-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`" \
    --template-file-gcs-location $TEMPLATE_FILE \
    --region $REGION \
    --staging-location "gs://$BUCKET/staging" \
    --parameters input="gs://dataflow-samples/shakespeare/hamlet.txt" \
    --parameters output="gs://$BUCKET/output" \
    --parameters sdk_container_image=$SDK_CONTAINER_IMAGE \
    --project $PROJECT
```

After the pipeline finishes, use the following command to inspect the output:
```
gsutil cat gs://$BUCKET/output*
```

## Optional: Update the dependencies in the requirements file and rebuild the Docker images

The top-level pipeline dependencies are defined in the `install_requires` section of the `setup.py` file.

The `requirements.txt` file pins all Python dependencies, that must be installed in the Docker container image, including the transitive dependencies. Listing all packages produces reproducible Python environments every time the image is built.
Version control the `requirements.txt` file together with the rest of pipeline code.

When the dependencies of your pipeline change or when you want to use the latest available versions of packages in the pipeline's dependency chain, regenerate the `requirements.txt` file:

```
    python3.11 -m pip install pip-tools   # Use a consistent minor version of Python throughout the project.
    pip-compile ./setup.py
```

If you base your custom container image on the standard Apache Beam base image, to reduce the image size and to give preference to the versions already installed in the Apache Beam base image, use a constraints file:

```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/release-2.54.0/sdks/python/container/py311/base_image_requirements.txt
   pip-compile --constraint=base_image_requirements.txt ./setup.py
```

Alternatively, take the following steps:

1. Use an empty `requirements.txt` file.
1. Build the SDK container Docker image from the Docker file.
1. Collect the output of `pip freeze` at the last stage of the Docker build.
1. Seed the `requirements.txt` file with that content.
