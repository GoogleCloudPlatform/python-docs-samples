"""Identifies buckets with relative increase in cost on enabling the soft-delete.

The relative increase in cost of using soft delete is calculated by combining
the storage/v2/deleted_bytes metric with the existing
storage/v2/total_byte_seconds
metric.

Relative cost of each bucket = deleted_bytes / total_byte_seconds
