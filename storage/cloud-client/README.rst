Samples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python quickstart.py


Snippets
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python snippets.py

    usage: snippets.py [-h]
                       bucket_name
                       {create-bucket,delete-bucket,get-bucket-labels,add-bucket-label,remove-bucket-label,list,list-with-prefix,upload,download,delete,metadata,make-public,signed-url,rename,copy}
                       ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations on blobs
    (objects) in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
    
    For more information, see the README.md under /storage  and the documentation
    at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs.
    
    positional arguments:
      bucket_name           Your cloud storage bucket.
      {create-bucket,delete-bucket,get-bucket-labels,add-bucket-label,remove-bucket-label,list,list-with-prefix,upload,download,delete,metadata,make-public,signed-url,rename,copy}
        create-bucket       Creates a new bucket.
        delete-bucket       Deletes a bucket. The bucket must be empty.
        get-bucket-labels   Prints out a bucket's labels.
        add-bucket-label    Add a label to a bucket.
        remove-bucket-label
                            Remove a label from a bucket.
        list                Lists all the blobs in the bucket.
        list-with-prefix    Lists all the blobs in the bucket that begin with the
                            prefix. This can be used to list all blobs in a
                            "folder", e.g. "public/". The delimiter argument can
                            be used to restrict the results to only the "files" in
                            the given "folder". Without the delimiter, the entire
                            tree under the prefix is returned. For example, given
                            these blobs: /a/1.txt /a/b/2.txt If you just specify
                            prefix = '/a', you'll get back: /a/1.txt /a/b/2.txt
                            However, if you specify prefix='/a' and delimiter='/',
                            you'll get back: /a/1.txt
        upload              Uploads a file to the bucket.
        download            Downloads a blob from the bucket.
        delete              Deletes a blob from the bucket.
        metadata            Prints out a blob's metadata.
        make-public         Makes a blob publicly accessible.
        signed-url          Generates a signed URL for a blob. Note that this
                            method requires a service account key file. You can
                            not use this if you are using Application Default
                            Credentials from Google Compute Engine or from the
                            Google Cloud SDK.
        rename              Renames a blob.
        copy                Renames a blob.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit


Access Control Lists
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    $ python acl.py

    usage: acl.py [-h]
                  {print-bucket-acl,print-bucket-acl-for-user,add-bucket-owner,remove-bucket-owner,add-bucket-default-owner,remove-bucket-default-owner,print-blob-acl,print-blob-acl-for-user,add-blob-owner,remove-blob-owner}
                  ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to manage access control lists (acls) in
    Google Cloud Storage.
    
    For more information, see the README.md under /storage and the documentation
    at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption.

        print-bucket-acl    Prints out a bucket's access control list.
        print-bucket-acl-for-user
                            Prints out a bucket's access control list.
        add-bucket-owner    Adds a user as an owner on the given bucket.
        remove-bucket-owner
                            Removes a user from the access control list of the
                            given bucket.

        remove-bucket-default-owner
                            Removes a user from the access control list of the
                            given bucket's default object access control list.
        print-blob-acl      Prints out a blob's access control list.
        print-blob-acl-for-user
                            Prints out a blob's access control list for a given
                            user.
        add-blob-owner      Adds a user as an owner on the given blob.
        remove-blob-owner   Removes a user from the access control list of the
                            given blob in the given bucket.
    
    optional arguments:

Customer-Supplied Encryption
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python encryption.py

    usage: encryption.py [-h] {generate-encryption-key,upload,download,rotate} ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to upload and download encrypted blobs
    (objects) in Google Cloud Storage.
    
    Use `generate-encryption-key` to generate an example key:
    
        python encryption.py generate-encryption-key
    
    Then use the key to upload and download files encrypted with a custom key.
    
    For more information, see the README.md under /storage and the documentation
    at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption.
    
    positional arguments:
      {generate-encryption-key,upload,download,rotate}
        generate-encryption-key
                            Generates a 256 bit (32 byte) AES encryption key and
                            prints the base64 representation. This is included for
                            demonstration purposes. You should generate your own
                            key. Please remember that encryption keys should be
                            handled with a comprehensive security policy.
        upload              Uploads a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket using
                            a custom encryption key. The file will be encrypted by
                            Google Cloud Storage and only retrievable using the
                            provided encryption key.
        download            Downloads a previously-encrypted blob from Google
                            Cloud Storage. The encryption key provided must be the
                            same key provided when uploading the blob.
        rotate              Performs a key rotation by re-writing an encrypted
                            blob with a new encryption key.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit


Notification Polling
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python notification_polling.py

    usage: notification_polling.py [-h] project subscription
    
    This application demonstrates how to poll for GCS notifications from a
    Cloud Pub/Sub subscription, parse the incoming message, and acknowledge the
    successful processing of the message.
    
    This application will work with any subscription configured for pull rather
    than push notifications. If you do not already have notifications configured,
    you may consult the docs at
    https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reporting-changes or follow the steps
    below:
    
    1. First, follow the common setup steps for these snippets, specically
       configuring auth and installing dependencies. See the README's "Setup"
       section.
    
    2. Activate the Google Cloud Pub/Sub API, if you have not already done so.
       https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=pubsub
    
    3. Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket:
       $ gsutil mb gs://testbucket
    
    4. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub topic and publish bucket notifications there:
       $ gsutil notification create -f json -t testtopic gs://testbucket
    
    5. Create a subscription for your new topic:
       $ gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions create testsubscription --topic=testtopic
    
    6. Run this program:
       $ python notification_polling.py my-project-id testsubscription
    
    7. While the program is running, upload and delete some files in the testbucket
       bucket (you could use the console or gsutil) and watch as changes scroll by
       in the app.
    
    positional arguments:
      project       The ID of the project that owns the subscription
      subscription  The ID of the Pub/Sub subscription
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help    show this help message and exit
