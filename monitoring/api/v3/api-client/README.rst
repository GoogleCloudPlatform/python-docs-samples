Stackdriver Monitoring Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Stackdriver Monitoring. `Stackdriver Monitoring `_ collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch and many others. Stackdriver ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through `Application Default Credentials`_,
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the `Google Cloud SDK`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud beta auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with `additional scopes`_.

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

List resources
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python list_resources.py

    usage: list_resources.py [-h] --project_id PROJECT_ID
    
     Sample command-line program for retrieving Stackdriver Monitoring API V3
    data.
    
    See README.md for instructions on setting up your development environment.
    
    To run locally:
    
        python list_resources.py --project_id=<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --project_id PROJECT_ID
                            Project ID you want to access.


Custom metrics
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python custom_metric.py

    usage: custom_metric.py [-h] --project_id PROJECT_ID
    
     Sample command-line program for writing and reading Stackdriver Monitoring
    API V3 custom metrics.
    
    Simple command-line program to demonstrate connecting to the Google
    Monitoring API to write custom metrics and read them back.
    
    See README.md for instructions on setting up your development environment.
    
    This example creates a custom metric based on a hypothetical GAUGE measurement.
    
    To run locally:
    
        python custom_metric.py --project_id=<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --project_id PROJECT_ID
                            Project ID you want to access.
