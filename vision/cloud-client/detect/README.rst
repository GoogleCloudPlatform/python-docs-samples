Google Cloud Vision API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Vision API. `Google Cloud Vision API`_ allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

- See the `migration guide`_ for information about migrating to Python client library v0.25.1.

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them. You may want to refer to the `Python Development Environment Setup Guide`_ for Google Cloud Platform for instructions.

 .. _Python Development Environment Setup Guide:
     https://cloud.google.com/python/setup

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Detect
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python detect.py

    usage: detect.py [-h]
                     {faces,faces-uri,labels,labels-uri,landmarks,landmarks-uri,text,text-uri,logos,logos-uri,safe-search,safe-search-uri,properties,properties-uri,web,web-uri,crophints,crophints-uri,document,document-uri}
                     ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations with the
    Google Cloud Vision API.
