<h1>Quotes Codelab</h1>

<p>This HTML is just an area where we can play around with Piper. The
idea is to <strong>add</strong> one or two html files with quotations,
and then <strong>edit</strong> this
<code>index.html</code> file to link to your quotation files.
When you're ready, <strong>submit</strong> the thing.
</p>

<!-- here we have a list of relative links to
  each quote file. Add links to your quote files.
