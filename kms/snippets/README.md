## Python Samples for Google Cloud Key Management Service

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Key Management Service, which may be used as a refererence for how to use Google Cloud Key Management Service. 
The Google Cloud KMS API is a service that allows you to keep encryption keys centrally in the cloud, for direct use by cloud services. More info about Cloud KMS can be found at https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/
Samples, quickstarts, and other documentation are available at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms">cloud.google.com</a>.


### Quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to create and use encryption keys with Cloud Key Management Service.
