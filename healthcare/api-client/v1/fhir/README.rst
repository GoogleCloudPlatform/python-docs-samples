This directory contains samples for Cloud Healthcare API. `Cloud Healthcare API`_ implements healthcare-native protocols and formats to accelerate ingestion, storage, analysis, and integration of healthcare data with cloud-based applications.
- See the `migration guide`_ for information about migrating to Python client library v0.25.1.

.. _migration guide: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/python-client-migration




.. _Cloud Healthcare API: https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs

To run the sample, you need to enable the API at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/healthcare.googleapis.com


To run the sample, you need to have the following roles:
* `Healthcare Dataset Administrator`
* `Healthcare FHIR Store Administrator`
* `Healthcare FHIR Resource Editor`



Setup

                            ImplementationGuide resource that exists in the FHIR
                            store. See
                            https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-

                            running the sample.
        validate-resource   Validates an input FHIR resource's conformance to the
                            base profile configured on the FHIR store. See

                            profile URL. The profile StructureDefinition resource
                            must exist in the FHIR store before performing
                            validation against the URL. See
